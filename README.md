# bigint: Big Integer in C
This library implements big integer arithmetic in C, it is desgined to be fast, portable, lightweight and easy to compile. Ideal for numerical applications involving big integers, such as cryptography.

I started working on this during my PhD studies (back in 2012), my goal is to make it available and public.

Don't hesitate in reaching me out if you have suggestions.
